# Blog Preview Card

My solution to the [Blog preview card challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/blog-preview-card-ckPaj01IcS). Built with pure HTML and CSS (mobile-first approach).

## Live Demo

## Built With
- HTML5
- CSS custom properties (variables)
- CSS Grid for centering
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Hover effects and precise styling to match the design

## What I Learned
- Strengthening mobile-first workflow
- Using CSS variables for consistent colors and typography
- Perfectly centering content vertically and horizontally with Grid

- Fine-tuning typography spacing, font weights, and hover states
- Controlling card width with max-width for consistency across devices
